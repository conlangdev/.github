**conlang.dev** is a tool for conlangers and linguists to document their languages.

## 🐻 About
This project is inspired by a desire for more open-ended tools that allow creative freedom in defining the limits of languages.
Inspired by tools like [Conworkshop](https://conworkshop.com) and [Lexique Pro](http://lexiquepro.com/), **conlang.dev** aims to sit somewhere between the two, with an extra focus on free-flowing documentation.
